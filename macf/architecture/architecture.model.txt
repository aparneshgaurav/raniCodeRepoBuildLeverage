https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJJoeWyqO-Htv2nP7oJv2iaKlDHdSLI4xm0VdqsMal4/edit


	when you say data platforms 
		you must also know reporting 
		you must also know ml 
		you must also know ingestion and compute 
		all of it 
		databases
		database modelling
		no sqls
		comparions of cloud vendors
----------
