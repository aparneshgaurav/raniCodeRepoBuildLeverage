quick ones from github for basic functionalities: 

…or create a new repository on the command line

echo "# thoughtsfly.com" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/aparneshgaurav/thoughtsfly.com.git
git push -u origin master
…or push an existing repository from the command line

git remote add origin https://github.com/aparneshgaurav/thoughtsfly.com.git
git push -u origin master

comment here that also to note that git local branch ahead of mater means that there are more files and more new changers in your local git repo than the git remote origin branch
